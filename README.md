# Recipe Tracker App 🍳

A silly recipe tracking app with intentional bugs for testing purposes.

## Features (with bugs!)
- Add recipes with ingredients and instructions
- Search through recipes (sort of)
- Rate recipes (when it works)
- Export recipes to... somewhere

## Running the App
```bash
npm start
```

## Known Issues
- There are definitely bugs, but that's the point!
- Don't use this for actual recipe tracking
- May cause hunger when viewing recipes
